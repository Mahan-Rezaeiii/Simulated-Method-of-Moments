# **Economics of The Labor Force (Spring 2025)**
This repository contains my personal project for the **Economics of The Labor Force** course offered by the Department of Economics at the [Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS)](https://teias.institute/).

---

## **Overview**

In this project, I implement the Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) to estimate the parameters of a simple AR(1) data-generating process.

The project proceeds as follows:
- Model Setup
- Moment Construction
- SMM Estimation (Just-identified cases \& Overidentified case)
- Identification Analysis
- Bootstrapping
